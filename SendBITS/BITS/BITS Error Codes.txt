BITS Return Values




The Bitsmsg.h file contains the following return value constants. The constants represent return values that BITS generates and HTTP return values that BITS captures. All other return values that you can receive are COM, RPC, or converted Windows return values (BITS uses the HRESULT_FROM_WIN32 macro to convert the Windows return values to HRESULT values).

Note that the Bitsmsg.h file contains additional return values not listed below. 


BG_S_PARTIAL_COMPLETE (0x00200017)


A subset of the job's files transferred successfully before the IBackgroundCopyJob::Complete method was called. Those that were not complete were deleted.

BG_S_UNABLE_TO_DELETE_FILES (0x0020001A)


Unable to delete all temporary files associated with the job.

BG_S_OVERRIDDEN_BY_POLICY (0x00200055)


The configuration preference has been saved successfully, but the preference will not be used because a configured Group Policy setting overrides the preference.

BG_E_NOT_FOUND (0x80200001)


The requested job was not found.

BG_E_INVALID_STATE (0x80200002)


The requested action is not allowed in the current job state. 

BG_E_EMPTY (0x80200003)


The job must contain one or more files before you can resume the job.

BG_E_FILE_NOT_AVAILABLE (0x80200004)


File information is not available because the error is not associated with a local or remote file.

BG_E_PROTOCOL_NOT_AVAILABLE (0x80200005)


Protocol information is not available because the error is not associated with the specified transfer protocol.

BG_E_DESTINATION_LOCKED (0x8020000D)


The destination file system volume, specified in the local file name, is locked.

BG_E_VOLUME_CHANGED (0x8020000E)


The destination volume, specified in the local file name, has changed. For example, the original floppy disk has been replaced with a different floppy disk.

BG_E_ERROR_INFORMATION_UNAVAILABLE (0x8020000F)


Error information is only available when the state of the job is BG_JOB_STATE_ERROR. The error information is not available after BITS begins transferring the job's data or the client exits.

The network adapter is inactive or disconnected. All jobs are placed in the BG_JOB_STATE_TRANSIENT_ERROR state.

BG_E_MISSING_FILE_SIZE (0x80200011)

The server does not support the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

BG_E_INSUFFICIENT_RANGE_SUPPORT (0x80200013)

You cannot add more than one file to an upload job.

BG_E_LOCAL_FILE_CHANGED (0x8020001D)

BG_E_STRING_TOO_LONG (0x80200021)
